In statistics, the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) or Schwarz information criterion (also SIC, SBC, SBIC) is a criterion for model selection among a finite set of models; the model with the lowest BIC is preferred.  It is based, in part, on the likelihood function and it is closely related to the Akaike information criterion (AIC).\nWhen fitting models, it is possible to increase the likelihood by adding parameters, but doing so may result in overfitting. Both BIC and AIC attempt to resolve this problem by introducing a penalty term for the number of parameters in the model; the penalty term is larger in BIC than in AIC.\nThe BIC was developed by Gideon E. Schwarz and published in a 1978 paper, where he gave a Bayesian argument for adopting it.\n\n\n== Definition ==\nThe BIC is formally defined as\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          B\n          I\n          C\n        \n        =\n        k\n        ln\n        \u2061\n        (\n        n\n        )\n        \u2212\n        2\n        ln\n        \u2061\n        (\n        \n          \n            \n              L\n              ^\n            \n          \n        \n        )\n        .\n         \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {BIC} =k\\ln(n)-2\\ln({\\widehat {L}}).\\ }\n  where\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              L\n              ^\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\hat {L}}}\n   = the maximized value of the likelihood function of the model \n  \n    \n      \n        M\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle M}\n  , i.e. \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              L\n              ^\n            \n          \n        \n        =\n        p\n        (\n        x\n        \u2223\n        \n          \n            \n              \u03b8\n              ^\n            \n          \n        \n        ,\n        M\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\hat {L}}=p(x\\mid {\\widehat {\\theta }},M)}\n  , where \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \u03b8\n              ^\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\widehat {\\theta }}}\n   are the parameter values that maximize the likelihood function;\n\n  \n    \n      \n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x}\n   = the observed data;\n\n  \n    \n      \n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n}\n   = the number of data points in \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x}\n  , the number of observations, or equivalently, the sample size;\n\n  \n    \n      \n        k\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle k}\n   = the number of parameters estimated by the model.

That is, unexplained variation in the dependent variable and the number of explanatory variables increase the value of BIC. Hence, lower BIC implies either fewer explanatory variables, better fit, or both. The strength of the evidence against the model with the higher BIC value can be summarized as follows:\nThe BIC generally penalizes free parameters more strongly than the Akaike information criterion, though it depends on the size of n and relative magnitude of n and k.\nIt is important to keep in mind that the BIC can be used to compare estimated models only when the numerical values of the dependent variable are identical for all models being compared. The models being compared need not be nested, unlike the case when models are being compared using an F-test or a likelihood ratio test.\n\n\n== BIC for high-dimensional model ==\nFor high dimensional model with the number of potential variables \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          p\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n        \u2192\n        \u221e\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle p_{n}\\rightarrow \\infty }\n  , and the true model size is bounded by a constant,  modified BICs has been proposed in Chen and Chen and Gao and Song.

The high dimensional pseudo-likelihood BIC is of the form:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          pseudo-BIC\n        \n        =\n        6\n        (\n        1\n        +\n        \u03b3\n        )\n        \u03c9\n        ln\n        \u2061\n        (\n        \n          p\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n        )\n        \n          k\n          \n            \u2217\n          \n        \n        \u2212\n        2\n        ln\n        \u2061\n        (\n        \n          \n            \n              L\n              ^\n            \n          \n        \n        )\n        ,\n         \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\text{pseudo-BIC}}=6(1+\\gamma )\\omega \\ln(p_{n})k^{*}-2\\ln({\\widehat {L}}),\\ }\n  where \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          k\n          \n            \u2217\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle k^{*}}\n   is an estimated degrees of freedom, and the constant  \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03c9\n        \u2265\n        1\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\omega \\geq 1}\n   is an unknown constant.\nTo achieve the theoretical model selection consistency for divergent \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          p\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle p_{n}}\n  , the two high dimensional BICs above require the multiplicative factor \n  \n    \n      \n        6\n        (\n        1\n        +\n        \u03b3\n        )\n        \u03c9\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 6(1+\\gamma )\\omega }\n  .
