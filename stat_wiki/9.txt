In statistics, the likelihood function (often simply called the likelihood) measures the goodness of fit of a statistical model to a sample of data for given values of the unknown parameters. It is formed from the joint probability distribution of the sample, but viewed and used as a function of the parameters only, thus treating the random variables as fixed at the observed values.The likelihood function describes a hypersurface whose peak, if it exists, represents the combination of model parameter values that maximize the probability of drawing the sample obtained. The procedure for obtaining these arguments of the maximum of the likelihood function is known as maximum likelihood estimation, which for computational convenience is usually done using the natural logarithm of the likelihood, known as the log-likelihood function. Additionally, the shape and curvature of the likelihood surface represent information about the stability of the estimates, which is why the likelihood function is often plotted as part of a statistical analysis.The case for using likelihood was first made by R. A. Fisher, who believed it to be a self-contained framework for statistical modelling and inference. Later, Barnard and Birnbaum led a school of thought that advocated the likelihood principle, postulating that all relevant information for inference is contained in the likelihood function. But even in frequentist and Bayesian statistics, the likelihood function plays a fundamental role.\n\n\n== Definition ==\nThe likelihood function is usually defined differently for discrete and continuous probability distributions.

The likelihood function is that density interpreted as a function of the parameter (possibly a vector), rather than the possible outcomes. This provides a likelihood function for any statistical model with all distributions, whether discrete, absolutely continuous, a mixture or something else.  (Likelihoods will be comparable, e.g. for parameter estimation, only if they are Radon\u2013Nikodym derivatives with respect to the same dominating measure.)\nThe discussion above of likelihood with discrete probabilities is a special case of this using the counting measure, which makes the probability of any single outcome equal to the probability density for that outcome.\nGiven no event (no data), the probability and thus likelihood is 1; any non-trivial event will have a lower likelihood.\n\n\n=== Likelihood function of a parameterized model ===\nAmong many applications, we consider here one of broad theoretical and practical importance.

above can be extended in a simple way to allow consideration of distributions which contain both discrete and continuous components. Suppose that the distribution consists of a number of discrete probability masses \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          p\n          \n            k\n          \n        \n        \u03b8\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle p_{k}\\theta }\n   and a density \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        (\n        x\n        \n          |\n        \n        \u03b8\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f(x|\\theta )}\n  , where the sum of all the \n  \n    \n      \n        p\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle p}\n  's added to the integral of \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f}\n   is always one. Assuming that it is possible to distinguish an observation corresponding to one of the discrete probability masses from one which corresponds to the density component, the likelihood function for an observation from the continuous component can be dealt with in the manner shown above. For an observation from the discrete component, the likelihood function for an observation from the discrete component is simply\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            L\n          \n        \n        (\n        \u03b8\n        \u2223\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        \n          p\n          \n            k\n          \n        \n        (\n        \u03b8\n        )\n        ,\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {L}}(\\theta \\mid x)=p_{k}(\\theta ),\\!}\n  where \n  \n    \n      \n        k\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle k}\n   is the index of the discrete probability mass corresponding to observation \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x}\n  , because maximizing the probability mass (or probability) at \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x}\n   amounts to maximizing the likelihood of the specific observation.\nThe fact that the likelihood function can be defined in a way that includes contributions that are not commensurate (the density and the probability mass) arises from the way in which the likelihood function is defined up to a constant of proportionality, where this "constant" can change with the observation \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x}\n  , but not with the parameter \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03b8\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\theta }\n  .\n\n\n=== Regularity conditions ===\nIn the context of parameter estimation, the likelihood function is usually assumed to obey certain conditions, known as regularity conditions. These conditions are assumed in various proofs involving likelihood functions, and need to be verified in each particular application. For maximum likelihood estimation, the existence of a global maximum of the likelihood function is of the utmost importance. By the extreme value theorem, a continuous likelihood function on a compact parameter space suffices for the existence of a maximum likelihood estimator. While the continuity assumption is usually met, the compactness assumption about the parameter space is often not, as the bounds of the true parameter values are unknown. In that case, concavity of the likelihood function plays a key role.\nMore specifically, if the likelihood function is twice continuously differentiable on the k-dimensional parameter space \n  \n    \n      \n        \u0398\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\Theta }\n   assumed to be an open connected subset of \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            R\n          \n          \n            k\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{k}}\n  , there exists a unique maximum \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \u03b8\n              ^\n            \n          \n        \n        \u2208\n        \u0398\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\hat {\\theta }}\\in \\Theta }\n   if\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          H\n        \n        (\n        \u03b8\n        )\n        =\n        \n          {\n          \n            \n              \n                \n                  \u2202\n                  \n                    2\n                  \n                \n                L\n              \n              \n                \u2202\n                \n                  \u03b8\n                  \n                    i\n                  \n                \n                \u2202\n                \n                  \u03b8\n                  \n                    j\n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n          }\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {H} (\\theta )=\\left\\{{\\frac {\\partial ^{2}L}{\\partial \\theta _{i}\\partial \\theta _{j}}}\\right\\}}\n   is negative definite at every \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03b8\n        \u2208\n        \u0398\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\theta \\in \\Theta }\n   for which gradient \n  \n    \n      \n        \u2207\n        L\n        =\n        \n          {\n          \n            \u2202\n            L\n            \n              /\n            \n            \u2202\n            \n              \u03b8\n              \n                i\n              \n            \n          \n          }\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\nabla L=\\left\\{\\partial L/\\partial \\theta _{i}\\right\\}}\n   vanishes, and\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          lim\n          \n            \u03b8\n            \u2192\n            \u2202\n            \u0398\n          \n        \n        L\n        (\n        \u03b8\n        )\n        =\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\lim _{\\theta \\to \\partial \\Theta }L(\\theta )=0}\n  , i.e. the likelihood function approaches a constant on the boundary of the parameter space, which may include the points at infinity if \n  \n    \n      \n        \u0398\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\Theta }\n   is unbounded.M\xe4kel\xe4inen et al. prove this result using Morse theory while informally appealing to a mountain pass property.

Further, in case of non-independently or non-identically distributed observations additional properties may need to be assumed.\n\n\n== Likelihood ratio and relative likelihood ==\n\n\n=== Likelihood ratio ===\nA likelihood ratio is the ratio of any two specified likelihoods, frequently written as:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \u039b\n        (\n        \n          \u03b8\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        :\n        \n          \u03b8\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        \u2223\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              \n                \n                  L\n                \n              \n              (\n              \n                \u03b8\n                \n                  1\n                \n              \n              \u2223\n              x\n              )\n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  L\n                \n              \n              (\n              \n                \u03b8\n                \n                  2\n                \n              \n              \u2223\n              x\n              )\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\Lambda (\\theta _{1}:\\theta _{2}\\mid x)={\\frac {{\\mathcal {L}}(\\theta _{1}\\mid x)}{{\\mathcal {L}}(\\theta _{2}\\mid x)}}}\n  The likelihood ratio is central to likelihoodist statistics: the law of likelihood states that degree to which data (considered as evidence) supports one parameter value versus another is measured by the likelihood ratio.\nIn frequentist inference, the likelihood ratio is the basis for a test statistic, the so-called likelihood-ratio test. By the Neyman\u2013Pearson lemma, this is the most powerful test for comparing two simple hypotheses at a given significance level. Numerous other tests can be viewed as likelihood-ratio tests or approximations thereof. The asymptotic distribution of the log-likelihood ratio, considered as a test statistic, is given by Wilks' theorem.\nThe likelihood ratio is also of central importance in Bayesian inference, where it is known as the Bayes factor, and is used in Bayes' rule. Stated in terms of odds, Bayes' rule is that the posterior odds of two alternatives, \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          A\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle A_{1}}\n   and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          A\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle A_{2}}\n  , given an event \n  \n    \n      \n        B\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle B}\n  , is the prior odds, times the likelihood ratio.

However, the odds ratio can also be interpreted as a ratio of two likelihoods ratios, if one considers one of the events to be more easily observable than the other. See diagnostic odds ratio, where the result of a diagnostic test is more easily observable than the presence or absence of an underlying medical condition.\n\n\n=== Relative likelihood function ===\n\nSince the actual value of the likelihood function depends on the sample, it is often convenient to work with a standardized measure. Suppose that the maximum likelihood estimate for the parameter \u03b8 is \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \u03b8\n              ^\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\hat {\\theta }}}\n  .  Relative plausibilities of other \u03b8 values may be found by comparing the likelihoods of those other values with the likelihood of \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \u03b8\n              ^\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\hat {\\theta }}}\n  .  The relative likelihood of \u03b8 is defined to be\n\n  \n    \n      \n        R\n        (\n        \u03b8\n        )\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              \n                \n                  L\n                \n              \n              (\n              \u03b8\n              \u2223\n              x\n              )\n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  L\n                \n              \n              (\n              \n                \n                  \n                    \u03b8\n                    ^\n                  \n                \n              \n              \u2223\n              x\n              )\n            \n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle R(\\theta )={\\frac {{\\mathcal {L}}(\\theta \\mid x)}{{\\mathcal {L}}({\\hat {\\theta }}\\mid x)}}.}\n  Thus, the relative likelihood is the likelihood ratio (discussed above) with the fixed denominator \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            L\n          \n        \n        (\n        \n          \n            \n              \u03b8\n              ^\n            \n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {L}}({\\hat {\\theta }})}\n  . This corresponds to standardizing the likelihood to have a maximum of 1.\n\n\n==== Likelihood region ====\nA likelihood region is the set of all values of \u03b8 whose relative likelihood is greater than or equal to a given threshold. In terms of percentages, a p% likelihood region for \u03b8 is defined to be\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          {\n          \n            \u03b8\n            :\n            R\n            (\n            \u03b8\n            )\n            \u2265\n            \n              \n                p\n                100\n              \n            \n          \n          }\n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\left\\{\\theta :R(\\theta )\\geq {\\frac {p}{100}}\\right\\}.}\n  If \u03b8 is a single real parameter, a p% likelihood region will usually comprise an interval of real values. If the region does comprise an interval, then it is called a likelihood interval.Likelihood intervals, and more generally likelihood regions, are used for interval estimation within likelihoodist statistics: they are similar to confidence intervals in frequentist statistics and credible intervals in Bayesian statistics. Likelihood intervals are interpreted directly in terms of relative likelihood, not in terms of coverage probability (frequentism) or posterior probability (Bayesianism).\nGiven a model, likelihood intervals can be compared to confidence intervals. If \u03b8 is a single real parameter, then under certain conditions, a 14.65% likelihood interval (about 1:7 likelihood) for \u03b8 will be the same as a 95% confidence interval (19/20 coverage probability). In a slightly different formulation suited to the use of log-likelihoods (see Wilks' theorem), the test statistic is twice the difference in log-likelihoods and the probability distribution of the test statistic is approximately a chi-squared distribution with degrees-of-freedom (df) equal to the difference in df's between the two models (therefore, the e\u22122 likelihood interval is the same as the 0.954 confidence interval; assuming difference in df's to be 1).\n\n\n== Likelihoods that eliminate nuisance parameters ==\nIn many cases, the likelihood is a function of more than one parameter but interest focuses on the estimation of only one, or at most a few of them, with the others being considered as nuisance parameters. Several alternative approaches have been developed to eliminate such nuisance parameters, so that a likelihood can be written as a function of only the parameter (or parameters) of interest: the main approaches are profile, conditional, and marginal likelihoods. These approaches are also useful when a high-dimensional likelihood surface needs to be reduced to one or two parameters of interest in order to allow a graph.\n\n\n=== Profile likelihood ===\nIt is possible to reduce the dimensions by concentrating the likelihood function for a subset of parameters by expressing the nuisance parameters as functions of the parameters of interest and replacing them in the likelihood function.

In addition to being graphed, the profile likelihood can also be used to compute confidence intervals that often have better small-sample properties than those based on asymptotic standard errors calculated from the full likelihood.\n\n\n=== Conditional likelihood ===\nSometimes it is possible to find a sufficient statistic for the nuisance parameters, and conditioning on this statistic results in a likelihood which does not depend on the nuisance parameters.One example occurs in 2\xd72 tables, where conditioning on all four marginal totals leads to a conditional likelihood based on the non-central hypergeometric distribution. This form of conditioning is also the basis for Fisher's exact test.\n\n\n=== Marginal likelihood ===\n\nSometimes we can remove the nuisance parameters by considering a likelihood based on only part of the information in the data, for example by using the set of ranks rather than the numerical values. Another example occurs in linear mixed models, where considering a likelihood for the residuals only after fitting the fixed effects leads to residual maximum likelihood estimation of the variance components.\n\n\n=== Partial likelihood ===\nA partial likelihood is an adaption of the full likelihood such that only a part of the parameters (the parameters of interest) occur in it. It is a key component of the proportional hazards model: using a restriction on the hazard function, the likelihood does not contain the shape of the hazard over time.\n\n\n== Products of likelihoods ==\nThe likelihood, given two or more independent events, is the product of the likelihoods of each of the individual events:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \u039b\n        (\n        A\n        \u2223\n        \n          X\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        \u2227\n        \n          X\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        )\n        =\n        \u039b\n        (\n        A\n        \u2223\n        \n          X\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        )\n        \u22c5\n        \u039b\n        (\n        A\n        \u2223\n        \n          X\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\Lambda (A\\mid X_{1}\\land X_{2})=\\Lambda (A\\mid X_{1})\\cdot \\Lambda (A\\mid X_{2})}\n  This follows from the definition of independence in probability: the probabilities of two independent events happening, given a model, is the product of the probabilities.\nThis is particularly important when the events are from independent and identically distributed random variables, such as independent observations or sampling with replacement. In such a situation, the likelihood function factors into a product of individual likelihood functions.\nThe empty product has value 1, which corresponds to the likelihood, given no event, being 1: before any data, the likelihood is always 1. This is similar to a uniform prior in Bayesian statistics, but in likelihoodist statistics this is not an improper prior because likelihoods are not integrated.\n\n\n== Log-likelihood ==\n\nLog-likelihood function is a logarithmic transformation of the likelihood function, often denoted by a lowercase l or \n  \n    \n      \n        \u2113\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\ell }\n  , to contrast with the uppercase L or \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            L\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {L}}}\n   for the likelihood. Because logarithms are strictly increasing functions, maximizing the likelihood is equivalent to maximizing the log-likelihood. But for practical purposes it is more convenient to work with the log-likelihood function in maximum likelihood estimation, in particular since most common probability distributions\u2014notably the exponential family\u2014are only logarithmically concave, and concavity of the objective function plays a key role in the maximization.\nGiven the independence of each event, the overall log-likelihood of intersection equals the sum of the log-likelihoods of the individual events. This is analogous to the fact that the overall log-probability is the sum of the log-probability of the individual events. In addition to the mathematical convenience from this, the adding process of log-likelihood has an intuitive interpretation, as often expressed as "support" from the data. When the parameters are estimated using the log-likelihood for the maximum likelihood estimation, each data point is used by being added to the total log-likelihood. As the data can be viewed as an evidence that support the estimated parameters, this process can be interpreted as "support from independent evidence adds", and the log-likelihood is the "weight of evidence". Interpreting negative log-probability as information content or surprisal, the support (log-likelihood) of a model, given an event, is the negative of the surprisal of the event, given the model: a model is supported by an event to the extent that the event is unsurprising, given the model.\nA logarithm of a likelihood ratio is equal to the difference of the log-likelihoods:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        log\n        \u2061\n        \n          \n            \n              L\n              (\n              A\n              )\n            \n            \n              L\n              (\n              B\n              )\n            \n          \n        \n        =\n        log\n        \u2061\n        L\n        (\n        A\n        )\n        \u2212\n        log\n        \u2061\n        L\n        (\n        B\n        )\n        =\n        \u2113\n        (\n        A\n        )\n        \u2212\n        \u2113\n        (\n        B\n        )\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\log {\\frac {L(A)}{L(B)}}=\\log L(A)-\\log L(B)=\\ell (A)-\\ell (B).}\n  Just as the likelihood, given no event, being 1, the log-likelihood, given no event, is 0, which corresponds to the value of the empty sum: without any data, there is no support for any models.\n\n\n=== Likelihood equations ===\nIf the log-likelihood function is smooth, its gradient with respect to the parameter, known as the score and written \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          s\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n        (\n        \u03b8\n        )\n        \u2261\n        \n          \u2207\n          \n            \u03b8\n          \n        \n        \n          \u2113\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n        (\n        \u03b8\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle s_{n}(\\theta )\\equiv \\nabla _{\\theta }\\ell _{n}(\\theta )}\n  , exists and allows for the application of differential calculus. The basic way to maximize a differentiable function is to find the stationary points (the points where the derivative is zero); since the derivative of a sum is just the sum of the derivatives, but the derivative of a product requires the product rule, it is easier to compute the stationary points of the log-likelihood of independent events than for the likelihood of independent events.\nThe equations defined by the stationary point of the score function serve as estimating equations for the maximum likelihood estimator.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          s\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n        (\n        \u03b8\n        )\n        =\n        \n          0\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle s_{n}(\\theta )=\\mathbf {0} }\n  In that sense, the maximum likelihood estimator is implicitly defined by the value at \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          0\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {0} }\n   of the inverse function \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          s\n          \n            n\n          \n          \n            \u2212\n            1\n          \n        \n        :\n        \n          \n            E\n          \n          \n            d\n          \n        \n        \u2192\n        \u0398\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle s_{n}^{-1}:\\mathbb {E} ^{d}\\to \\Theta }\n  , where \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            E\n          \n          \n            d\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {E} ^{d}}\n   is the d-dimensional Euclidean space.

and interpretation ==\n\n\n=== Historical remarks ===\n\nThe term "likelihood" has been in use in English since at least late Middle English. Its formal use to refer to a specific function in mathematical statistics was proposed by Ronald Fisher, in two research papers published in 1921 and 1922. The 1921 paper introduced what is today called a "likelihood interval"; the 1922 paper introduced the term "method of maximum likelihood". Quoting Fisher:\n\n[I]n 1922, I proposed the term \u2018likelihood,\u2019 in view of the fact that, with respect to [the parameter], it is not a probability, and does not obey the laws of probability, while at the same time it bears to the problem of rational choice among the possible values of [the parameter] a relation similar to that which probability bears to the problem of predicting events in games of chance. . . .Whereas, however, in relation to psychological judgment, likelihood has some resemblance to probability, the two concepts are wholly distinct. . . .\u201d\nThe concept of likelihood should not be confused with probability as mentioned by Sir Ronald Fisher\n\nI stress this because in spite of the emphasis that I have always laid upon the difference between probability and likelihood there is still a tendency to treat likelihood as though it were a sort of probability. The first result is thus that there are two different measures of rational belief appropriate to different cases. Knowing the population we can express our incomplete knowledge of, or expectation of, the sample in terms of probability; knowing the sample we can express our incomplete knowledge of the population in terms of likelihood.\nFisher's invention of statistical likelihood was in reaction against an earlier form of reasoning called inverse probability. His use of the term "likelihood" fixed the meaning of the term within mathematical statistics.\nA. W. F. Edwards (1972) established the axiomatic basis for use of the log-likelihood ratio as a measure of relative support for one hypothesis against another. The support function is then the natural logarithm of the likelihood function. Both terms are used in phylogenetics, but were not adopted in a general treatment of the topic of statistical evidence.\n\n\n=== Interpretations under different foundations ===\nAmong statisticians, there is no consensus about what the foundation of statistics should be. There are four main paradigms that have been proposed for the foundation: frequentism, Bayesianism, likelihoodism, and AIC-based. For each of the proposed foundations, the interpretation of likelihood is different. The four interpretations are described in the subsections below.\n\n\n==== Frequentist interpretation ====\n\n\n==== Bayesian interpretation ====\nIn Bayesian inference, although one can speak about the likelihood of any proposition or random variable given another random variable: for example the likelihood of a parameter value or of a statistical model (see marginal likelihood), given specified data or other evidence, the likelihood function remains the same entity, with the additional interpretations of (i) a conditional density of the data given the parameter (since the parameter is then a random variable) and (ii) a measure or amount of information brought by the data about the parameter value or even the model. Due to the introduction of a probability structure on the parameter space or on the collection of models, it is possible that a parameter value or a statistical model have a large likelihood value for given data, and yet have a low probability, or vice versa. This is often the case in medical contexts. Following Bayes' Rule, the likelihood when seen as a conditional density can be multiplied by the prior probability density of the parameter and then normalized, to give a posterior probability density. More generally, the likelihood of an unknown quantity \n  \n    \n      \n        X\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle X}\n   given another unknown quantity \n  \n    \n      \n        Y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle Y}\n   is proportional to the probability of \n  \n    \n      \n        Y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle Y}\n   given \n  \n    \n      \n        X\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle X}\n  .\n\n\n==== Likelihoodist interpretation ====\nIn frequentist statistics, the likelihood function is itself a statistic that summarizes a single sample from a population, whose calculated value depends on a choice of several parameters \u03b81 ... \u03b8p, where p is the count of parameters in some already-selected statistical model. The value of the likelihood serves as a figure of merit for the choice used for the parameters, and the parameter set with maximum likelihood is the best choice, given the data available.\nThe specific calculation of the likelihood is the probability that the observed sample would be assigned, assuming that the model chosen and the values of the several parameters \u03b8 give an accurate approximation of the frequency distribution of the population that the observed sample was drawn from. Heuristically, it makes sense that a good choice of parameters is those which render the sample actually observed the maximum possible post-hoc probability of having happened. Wilks' theorem quantifies the heuristic rule by showing that the difference in the logarithm of the likelihood generated by the estimate\u2019s parameter values and the logarithm of the likelihood generated by population\u2019s "true" (but unknown) parameter values is \u03c7\xb2 distributed.\nEach independent sample's maximum likelihood estimate is a separate estimate of the "true" parameter set describing the population sampled. Successive estimates from many independent samples will cluster together with the population\u2019s "true" set of parameter values hidden somewhere in their midst. The difference in the logarithms of the maximum likelihood and adjacent parameter sets\u2019 likelihoods may be used to draw a confidence region on a plot whose co-ordinates are the parameters \u03b81 ... \u03b8p. The region surrounds the maximum-likelihood estimate, and all points (parameter sets) within that region differ at most in log-likelihood by some fixed value. The \u03c7\xb2 distribution given by Wilks' theorem converts the region's log-likelihood differences into the "confidence" that the population's "true" parameter set lies inside. The art of choosing the fixed log-likelihood difference is to make the confidence acceptably high while keeping the region acceptably small (narrow range of estimates).\nAs more data are observed, instead of being used to make independent estimates, they can be combined with the previous samples to make a single combined sample, and that large sample may be used for a new maximum likelihood estimate. As the size of the combined sample increases, the size of the likelihood region with the same confidence shrinks. Eventually, either the size of the confidence region is very nearly a single point, or the entire population has been sampled; in both cases, the estimated parameter set is essentially the same as the population parameter set.\n\n\n==== AIC-based interpretation ====\nUnder the AIC paradigm, likelihood is interpreted within the context of information theory.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nAzzalini, Adelchi (1996).
