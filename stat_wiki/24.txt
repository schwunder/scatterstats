In estimation theory and decision theory, a Bayes estimator or a Bayes action is an estimator or decision rule that minimizes the posterior expected value of a loss function (i.e., the posterior expected loss). Equivalently, it maximizes the posterior expectation of a utility function. An alternative way of formulating an estimator within Bayesian statistics is maximum a posteriori estimation.\n\n\n== Definition ==\nSuppose an unknown parameter \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03b8\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\theta }\n   is known to have a prior distribution \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03c0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\pi }\n  .

A conjugate prior is defined as a prior distribution belonging to some parametric family, for which the resulting posterior distribution also belongs to the same family. This is an important property, since the Bayes estimator, as well as its statistical properties (variance, confidence interval, etc.), can all be derived from the posterior distribution.\nConjugate priors are especially useful for sequential estimation, where the posterior of the current measurement is used as the prior in the next measurement. In sequential estimation, unless a conjugate prior is used, the posterior distribution typically becomes more complex with each added measurement, and the Bayes estimator cannot usually be calculated without resorting to numerical methods.\nFollowing are some examples of conjugate priors.\n\nIf \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n        \n          |\n        \n        \u03b8\n      \n    \n

For example, there is no distribution (covering the set, R, of all real numbers) for which every real number is equally likely. Yet, in some sense, such a "distribution" seems like a natural choice for a non-informative prior, i.e., a prior distribution which does not imply a preference for any particular value of the unknown parameter. One can still define a function \n  \n    \n      \n        p\n        (\n        \u03b8\n        )\n        =\n        1\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle p(\\theta )=1}\n  , but this would not be a proper probability distribution since it has infinite mass,\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \u222b\n        \n          p\n          (\n          \u03b8\n          )\n          d\n          \u03b8\n        \n        =\n        \u221e\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\int {p(\\theta )d\\theta }=\\infty .}\n  Such measures \n  \n    \n      \n        p\n        (\n        \u03b8\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle p(\\theta )}\n  , which are not probability distributions, are referred to as improper priors.\nThe use of an improper prior means that the Bayes risk is undefined (since the prior is not a probability distribution and we cannot take an expectation under it). As a consequence, it is no longer meaningful to speak of a Bayes estimator that minimizes the Bayes risk. Nevertheless, in many cases, one can define the posterior distribution\n\n  \n    \n      \n        p\n        (\n        \u03b8\n        \n          |\n        \n        x\n        )\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              p\n              (\n              x\n              \n                |\n              \n              \u03b8\n              )\n              p\n              (\n              \u03b8\n              )\n            \n            \n              \u222b\n              p\n              (\n              x\n              \n                |\n              \n              \u03b8\n              )\n              p\n              (\n              \u03b8\n              )\n              d\n              \u03b8\n            \n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle p(\\theta |x)={\\frac {p(x|\\theta )p(\\theta )}{\\int p(x|\\theta )p(\\theta )d\\theta }}.}\n  This is a definition, and not an application of Bayes' theorem, since Bayes' theorem can only be applied when all distributions are proper. However, it is not uncommon for the resulting "posterior" to be a valid probability distribution.

Empirical Bayes methods enable the use of auxiliary empirical data, from observations of related parameters, in the development of a Bayes estimator. This is done under the assumption that the estimated parameters are obtained from a common prior. For example, if independent observations of different parameters are performed, then the estimation performance of a particular parameter can sometimes be improved by using data from other observations.\nThere are parametric and non-parametric approaches to empirical Bayes estimation. Parametric empirical Bayes is usually preferable since it is more applicable and more accurate on small amounts of data.\n\n\n=== Example ===\nThe following is a simple example of parametric empirical Bayes estimation.

The following are some specific examples of admissibility theorems.\n\nIf a Bayes rule is unique then it is admissible. For example, as stated above, under mean squared error (MSE) the Bayes rule is unique and therefore admissible.\nIf \u03b8 belongs to a discrete set, then all Bayes rules are admissible.\nIf \u03b8 belongs to a continuous (non-discrete) set, and if the risk function R(\u03b8,\u03b4) is continuous in \u03b8 for every \u03b4, then all Bayes rules are admissible.By contrast, generalized Bayes rules often have undefined Bayes risk in the case of improper priors. These rules are often inadmissible and the verification of their admissibility can be difficult. For example, the generalized Bayes estimator of a location parameter \u03b8 based on Gaussian samples (described in the "Generalized Bayes estimator" section above) is inadmissible for \n  \n    \n      \n        p\n        >\n        2\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle p>2}\n  ; this is known as Stein's phenomenon.\n\n\n=== Asymptotic efficiency ===\nLet \u03b8 be an unknown random variable, and suppose that \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \u2026\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x_{1},x_{2},\\ldots }\n   are iid samples with density \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        (\n        \n          x\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        \n          |\n        \n        \u03b8\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f(x_{i}|\\theta )}\n  .

Under specific conditions, for large samples (large values of n), the posterior density of \u03b8 is approximately normal. In other words, for large n, the effect of the prior probability on the posterior is negligible. Moreover, if \u03b4 is the Bayes estimator under MSE risk, then it is asymptotically unbiased and it converges in distribution to the normal distribution:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            n\n          \n        \n        (\n        \n          \u03b4\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n        \u2212\n        \n          \u03b8\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n        )\n        \u2192\n        N\n        \n          (\n          \n            0\n            ,\n            \n              \n                1\n                \n                  I\n                  (\n                  \n                    \u03b8\n                    \n                      0\n                    \n                  \n                  )\n                \n              \n            \n          \n          )\n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {n}}(\\delta _{n}-\\theta _{0})\\to N\\left(0,{\\frac {1}{I(\\theta _{0})}}\\right),}\n  where I(\u03b80) is the fisher information of \u03b80.\nIt follows that the Bayes estimator \u03b4n under MSE is asymptotically efficient.\nAnother estimator which is asymptotically normal and efficient is the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE). The relations between the maximum likelihood and Bayes estimators can be shown in the following simple example.\n\n\n==== Example: estimating p in a binomial distribution ====\nConsider the estimator of \u03b8 based on binomial sample x~b(\u03b8,n) where \u03b8 denotes the probability for success. Assuming \u03b8 is distributed according to the conjugate prior, which in this case is the Beta distribution B(a,b), the posterior distribution is known to be B(a+x,b+n-x). Thus, the Bayes estimator under MSE is\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \u03b4\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n        (\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        E\n        [\n        \u03b8\n        \n          |\n        \n        x\n        ]\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              a\n              +\n              x\n            \n            \n              a\n              +\n              b\n              +\n              n\n            \n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\delta _{n}(x)=E[\\theta |x]={\\frac {a+x}{a+b+n}}.}\n  The MLE in this case is x/n and so we get,\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \u03b4\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n        (\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              a\n              +\n              b\n            \n            \n              a\n              +\n              b\n              +\n              n\n            \n          \n        \n        E\n        [\n        \u03b8\n        ]\n        +\n        \n          \n            n\n            \n              a\n              +\n              b\n              +\n              n\n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \u03b4\n          \n            M\n            L\n            E\n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\delta _{n}(x)={\\frac {a+b}{a+b+n}}E[\\theta ]+{\\frac {n}{a+b+n}}\\delta _{MLE}.}\n  The last equation implies that, for n \u2192 \u221e, the Bayes estimator (in the described problem) is close to the MLE.\nOn the other hand, when n is small, the prior information is still relevant to the decision problem and affects the estimate. To see the relative weight of the prior information, assume that a=b; in this case each measurement brings in 1 new bit of information; the formula above shows that the prior information has the same weight as a+b bits of the new information. In applications, one often knows very little about fine details of the prior distribution; in particular, there is no reason to assume that it coincides with B(a,b) exactly. In such a case, one possible interpretation of this calculation is: "there is a non-pathological prior distribution with the mean value 0.5 and the standard deviation d which gives the weight of prior information equal to 1/(4d2)-1 bits of new information."\nAnother example of the same phenomena is the case when the prior estimate and a measurement are normally distributed.  If the prior is centered at B with deviation \u03a3, and the measurement is centered at b with deviation \u03c3, then the posterior is centered at \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \u03b1\n            \n              \u03b1\n              +\n              \u03b2\n            \n          \n        \n        B\n        +\n        \n          \n            \u03b2\n            \n              \u03b1\n              +\n              \u03b2\n            \n          \n        \n        b\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\frac {\\alpha }{\\alpha +\\beta }}B+{\\frac {\\beta }{\\alpha +\\beta }}b}\n  , with weights in this weighted average being \u03b1=\u03c3\xb2, \u03b2=\u03a3\xb2. Moreover, the squared posterior deviation is \u03a3\xb2+\u03c3\xb2.  In other words, the prior is combined with the measurement in exactly the same way as if it were an extra measurement to take into account.\nFor example, if \u03a3=\u03c3/2, then the deviation of 4 measurements combined together matches the deviation of the prior (assuming that errors of measurements are independent).  And the weights \u03b1,\u03b2 in the formula for posterior match this: the weight of the prior is 4 times the weight of the measurement.  Combining this prior with n measurements with average v results in the posterior centered at \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            4\n            \n              4\n              +\n              n\n            \n          \n        \n        V\n        +\n        \n          \n            n\n            \n              4\n              +\n              n\n            \n          \n        \n        v\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\frac {4}{4+n}}V+{\\frac {n}{4+n}}v}\n  ; in particular, the prior plays the same role as 4 measurements made in advance.  In general, the prior has the weight of (\u03c3/\u03a3)\xb2 measurements.\nCompare to the example of binomial distribution: there the prior has the weight of (\u03c3/\u03a3)\xb2\u22121 measurements.  One can see that the exact weight does depend on the details of the distribution, but when \u03c3\u226b\u03a3, the difference becomes small.\n\n\n== Practical example of Bayes estimators ==\nThe Internet Movie Database uses a formula for calculating and comparing the ratings of films by its users, including their Top Rated 250 Titles which is claimed to give "a true Bayesian estimate". The following Bayesian formula was initially used to calculate a weighted average score for the Top 250, though the formula has since changed:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        W\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              R\n              v\n              +\n              C\n              m\n            \n            \n              v\n              +\n              m\n            \n          \n        \n         \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle W={Rv+Cm \\over v+m}\\ }\n  where:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        W\n         \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle W\\ }\n   = weighted rating\n\n  \n    \n      \n        R\n         \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle R\\ }\n   = average rating for the movie as a number from 1 to 10 (mean) = (Rating)\n\n  \n    \n      \n        v\n         \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle v\\ }\n   = number of votes/ratings for the movie = (votes)\n\n  \n    \n      \n        m\n         \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle m\\ }\n   = weight given to the prior estimate (in this case, the number of votes IMDB deemed necessary for average rating to approach statistical validity)\n\n  \n    \n      \n        C\n         \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle C\\ }\n   = the mean vote across the whole pool (currently 7.0)Note that W is just the weighted arithmetic mean of R and C with weight vector (v, m).  As the number of ratings surpasses m, the confidence of the average rating surpasses the confidence of the prior knowledge, and the weighted bayesian rating (W) approaches a straight average (R). The closer v (the number of ratings for the film) is to zero, the closer W gets to C, where W is the weighted rating and C is the average rating of all films. So, in simpler terms, the fewer ratings/votes cast for a film, the more that film's Weighted Rating will skew towards the average across all films, while films with many ratings/votes will have a rating approaching its pure arithmetic average rating.\nIMDb's approach ensures that a film with only a few ratings, all at 10, would not rank above "the Godfather", for example, with a 9.2 average from over 500,000 ratings.\n\n\n== See also ==\nRecursive Bayesian estimation\nGeneralized expected utility\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nLehmann, E.
