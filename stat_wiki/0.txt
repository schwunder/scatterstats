In statistical decision theory, an admissible decision rule is a rule for making a decision such that there is no other rule that is always "better" than it (or at least sometimes better and never worse), in the precise sense of "better" defined below. This concept is analogous to Pareto efficiency.\n\n\n== Definition ==\nDefine sets \n  \n    \n      \n        \u0398\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\Theta \\,}\n  , \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            X\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {X}}}\n   and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            A\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {A}}}\n  , where \n  \n    \n      \n        \u0398\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\Theta \\,}\n   are the states of nature, \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            X\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {X}}}\n   the possible observations, and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            A\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {A}}}\n   the actions that may be taken.

There may be more than one generalized Bayes rule, since there may be multiple choices of \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03b4\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\delta (x)\\,\\!}\n   that achieve the same expected loss.\nAt first, this may appear rather different from the Bayes rule approach of the previous section, not a generalization.  However, notice that the Bayes risk already averages over \n  \n    \n      \n        \u0398\n        \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\Theta \\,\\!}\n   in Bayesian fashion, and the Bayes risk may be recovered as the expectation over \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            X\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {X}}}\n   of the expected loss (where \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n        \u223c\n        \u03b8\n        \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x\\sim \\theta \\,\\!}\n   and \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03b8\n        \u223c\n        \u03c0\n        \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\theta \\sim \\pi \\,\\!}\n  ).  Roughly speaking, \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03b4\n        \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\delta \\,\\!}\n   minimizes this expectation of expected loss (i.e., is a Bayes rule) if and only if it minimizes the expected loss for each \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n        \u2208\n        \n          \n            X\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x\\in {\\mathcal {X}}}\n   separately (i.e., is a generalized Bayes rule).\nThen why is the notion of generalized Bayes rule an improvement?  It is indeed equivalent to the notion of Bayes rule when a Bayes rule exists and all \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n        \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x\\,\\!}\n   have positive probability.  However, no Bayes rule exists if the Bayes risk is infinite (for all \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03b4\n        \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\delta \\,\\!}\n  ).  In this case it is still useful to define a generalized Bayes rule \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03b4\n        \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\delta \\,\\!}\n  , which at least chooses a minimum-expected-loss action \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03b4\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\delta (x)\\!\\,}\n   for those \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n        \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x\\,\\!}\n   for which a finite-expected-loss action does exist.  In addition, a generalized Bayes rule may be desirable because it must choose a minimum-expected-loss action \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03b4\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\delta (x)\\,\\!}\n   for every \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n        \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x\\,\\!}\n  , whereas a Bayes rule would be allowed to deviate from this policy on a set \n  \n    \n      \n        X\n        \u2286\n        \n          \n            X\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle X\\subseteq {\\mathcal {X}}}\n   of measure 0 without affecting the Bayes risk.\nMore important, it is sometimes convenient to use an improper prior \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03c0\n        (\n        \u03b8\n        )\n        \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\pi (\\theta )\\,\\!}\n  .  In this case, the Bayes risk is not even well-defined, nor is there any well-defined distribution over \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n        \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x\\,\\!}\n  .  However, the posterior \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03c0\n        (\n        \u03b8\n        \u2223\n        x\n        )\n        \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\pi (\\theta \\mid x)\\,\\!}\n  \u2014and hence the expected loss\u2014may be well-defined for each \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n        \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x\\,\\!}\n  , so that it is still possible to define a generalized Bayes rule.\n\n\n=== Admissibility of (generalized) Bayes rules ===\nAccording to the complete class theorems, under mild conditions every admissible rule is a (generalized) Bayes rule (with respect to some prior \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03c0\n        (\n        \u03b8\n        )\n        \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\pi (\\theta )\\,\\!}\n  \u2014possibly an improper one\u2014that favors distributions \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03b8\n        \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\theta \\,\\!}\n   where that rule achieves low risk). Thus, in frequentist decision theory it is sufficient to consider only (generalized) Bayes rules.\nConversely, while Bayes rules with respect to proper priors are virtually always admissible, generalized Bayes rules corresponding to improper priors need not yield admissible procedures. Stein's example is one such famous situation.\n\n\n== Examples ==\nThe James\u2013Stein estimator is a nonlinear estimator of the mean of Gaussian random vectors which can be shown to dominate, or outperform, the ordinary least squares technique with respect to a mean-square error loss function. Thus least squares estimation is not an admissible estimation procedure in this context. Some others of the standard estimates associated with the normal distribution are also inadmissible: for example, the sample estimate of the variance when the population mean and variance are unknown.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nCox, D.
