Gated recurrent units (GRUs) are a gating mechanism in recurrent neural networks, introduced in 2014 by Kyunghyun Cho et al. The GRU is like a long short-term memory (LSTM) with a forget gate but has fewer parameters than LSTM, as it lacks an output gate. \nGRU's performance on certain tasks of polyphonic music modeling, speech signal modeling and natural language processing was found to be similar to that of LSTM \nGRUs have been shown to exhibit even better performance on certain smaller and less frequent datasets. However, as shown by Gail Weiss, Yoav Goldberg and Eran Yahav, the LSTM  is "strictly stronger" than the GRU as it can  easily perform unbounded counting, while the GRU cannot. That's why the GRU fails to learn simple languages that are learnable by the LSTM.Similarly, as shown by Denny Britz,  Anna Goldie,  Minh-Thang Luong and Quoc Le of Google Brain, LSTM cells consistently outperform GRU cells in "the first large-scale analysis of architecture variations for Neural Machine Translation."\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThere are several variations on the full gated unit, with gating done using the previous hidden state and the bias in various combinations, and a simplified form called minimal gated unit.\n\nThe operator \n  \n    \n      \n        \u2299\n
