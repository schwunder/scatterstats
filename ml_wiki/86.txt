These datasets are used for machine-learning research and have been cited in peer-reviewed academic journals. Datasets are an integral part of the field of machine learning. Major advances in this field can result from advances in learning algorithms (such as deep learning), computer hardware, and, less-intuitively, the availability of high-quality training datasets. High-quality labeled training datasets for supervised and semi-supervised machine learning algorithms are usually difficult and expensive to produce because of the large amount of time needed to label the data. Although they do not need to be labeled, high-quality datasets for unsupervised learning can also be difficult and costly to produce.\n\n\n== Image data ==\nDatasets consisting primarily of images or videos for tasks such as object detection, facial recognition, and multi-label classification.\n\n\n=== Facial recognition ===\nIn computer vision, face images have been used extensively to develop facial recognition systems, face detection, and many other projects that use images of faces.\n\n\n=== Action recognition ===\n\n\n=== Object detection and recognition ===\n\n\n=== Handwriting and character recognition ===\n\n\n=== Aerial images ===\n\n\n=== Other images ===\n\n\n== Text data ==\nDatasets consisting primarily of text for tasks such as natural language processing, sentiment analysis, translation, and cluster analysis.\n\n\n=== Reviews ===\n\n\n=== News articles ===\n\n\n=== Messages ===\n\n\n=== Twitter and tweets ===\n\n\n=== Dialogues ===\n\n\n=== Other text ===\n\n\n== Sound data ==\nDatasets of sounds and sound features.\n\n\n=== Speech ===\n\n\n=== Music ===\n\n\n=== Other sounds ===\n\n\n== Signal data ==\nDatasets containing electric signal information requiring some sort of Signal processing for further analysis.\n\n\n=== Electrical ===\n\n\n=== Motion-tracking ===\n\n\n=== Other signals ===\n\n\n== Physical data ==\nDatasets from physical systems.\n\n\n=== High-energy physics ===\n\n\n=== Systems ===\n\n\n=== Astronomy ===\n\n\n=== Earth science ===\n\n\n=== Other physical ===\n\n\n== Biological data ==\nDatasets from biological systems.\n\n\n=== Human ===\n\n\n=== Animal ===\n\n\n=== Plant ===\n\n\n=== Microbe ===\n\n\n=== Drug Discovery ===\n\n\n== Anomaly data ==\n\n\n== Question Answering data ==\nThis section includes datasets that deals with structured data.\n\n\n== Multivariate data ==\nDatasets consisting of rows of observations and columns of attributes characterizing those observations.
