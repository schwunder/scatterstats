Supervised learning is the machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs. It infers a function from labeled training data consisting of a set of training examples.  In supervised learning, each example is a pair consisting of an input object (typically a vector) and a desired output value (also called the supervisory signal).  A supervised learning algorithm analyzes the training data and produces an inferred function, which can be used for mapping new examples. An optimal scenario will allow for the algorithm to correctly determine the class labels for unseen instances. This requires the learning algorithm to generalize from the training data to unseen situations in a "reasonable" way (see inductive bias).\nThe parallel task in human and animal psychology is often referred to as concept learning.\n\n\n== Steps ==\nIn order to solve a given problem of supervised learning, one has to perform the following steps:\n\nDetermine the type of training examples. Before doing anything else, the user should decide what kind of data is to be used as a training set. In the case of handwriting analysis, for example, this might be a single handwritten character, an entire handwritten word, or an entire line of handwriting.\nGather a training set. The training set needs to be representative of the real-world use of the function. Thus, a set of input objects is gathered and corresponding outputs are also gathered, either from human experts or from measurements.\nDetermine the input feature representation of the learned function. The accuracy of the learned function depends strongly on how the input object is represented. Typically, the input object is transformed into a feature vector, which contains a number of features that are descriptive of the object. The number of features should not be too large, because of the curse of dimensionality; but should contain enough information to accurately predict the output.\nDetermine the structure of the learned function and corresponding learning algorithm. For example, the engineer may choose to use support vector machines or decision trees.\nComplete the design. Run the learning algorithm on the gathered training set. Some supervised learning algorithms require the user to determine certain control parameters. These parameters may be adjusted by optimizing performance on a subset (called a validation set) of the training set, or via cross-validation.\nEvaluate the accuracy of the learned function. After parameter adjustment and learning, the performance of the resulting function should be measured on a test set that is separate from the training set.\n\n\n== Algorithm choice ==\nA wide range of supervised learning algorithms are available, each with its strengths and weaknesses. There is no single learning algorithm that works best on all supervised learning problems (see the No free lunch theorem).\nThere are four major issues to consider in supervised learning:\n\n\n=== Bias-variance tradeoff ===\n\nA first issue is the tradeoff between bias and variance.  Imagine that we have available several different, but equally good, training data sets.  A learning algorithm is biased for a particular input \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x}\n   if, when trained on each of these data sets, it is systematically incorrect when predicting the correct output for \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x}\n  .  A learning algorithm has high variance for a particular input \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x}\n   if it predicts different output values when trained on different training sets.  The prediction error of a learned classifier is related to the sum of the bias and the variance of the learning algorithm.  Generally, there is a tradeoff between bias and variance.  A learning algorithm with low bias must be "flexible" so that it can fit the data well.  But if the learning algorithm is too flexible, it will fit each training data set differently, and hence have high variance.  A key aspect of many supervised learning methods is that they are able to adjust this tradeoff between bias and variance (either automatically or by providing a bias/variance parameter that the user can adjust).\n\n\n=== Function complexity and amount of training data ===\nThe second issue is the amount of training data available relative to the complexity of the "true" function (classifier or regression function).  If the true function is simple, then an "inflexible" learning algorithm with high bias and low variance will be able to learn it from a small amount of data.  But if the true function is highly complex (e.g., because it involves complex interactions among many different input features and behaves differently in different parts of the input space), then the function will only be able to learn from a very large amount of training data and using a "flexible" learning algorithm with low bias and high variance.There is a clear demarcation between the input and the desired output.\n\n\n=== Dimensionality of the input space ===\nA third issue is the dimensionality of the input space.  If the input feature vectors have very high dimension, the learning problem can be difficult even if the true function only depends on a small number of those features.  This is because the many "extra" dimensions can confuse the learning algorithm and cause it to have high variance.  Hence, high input dimensional typically requires tuning the classifier to have low variance and high bias.  In practice, if the engineer can manually remove irrelevant features from the input data, this is likely to improve the accuracy of the learned function.  In addition, there are many algorithms for feature selection that seek to identify the relevant features and discard the irrelevant ones.  This is an instance of the more general strategy of dimensionality reduction, which seeks to map the input data into a lower-dimensional space prior to running the supervised learning algorithm.\n\n\n=== Noise in the output values ===\nA fourth issue is the degree of noise in the desired output values (the supervisory target variables).  If the desired output values are often incorrect (because of human error or sensor errors), then the learning algorithm should not attempt to find a function that exactly matches the training examples.  Attempting to fit the data too carefully leads to overfitting.  You can overfit even when there are no measurement errors (stochastic noise) if the function you are trying to learn is too complex for your learning model. In such a situation, the part of the target function that cannot be modeled "corrupts" your training data - this phenomenon has been called deterministic noise. When either type of noise is present, it is better to go with a higher bias, lower variance estimator.\nIn practice, there are several approaches to alleviate noise in the output values such as early stopping to prevent overfitting as well as detecting and removing the noisy training examples prior to training the supervised learning algorithm.  There are several algorithms that identify noisy training examples and removing the suspected noisy training examples prior to training has decreased generalization error with statistical significance.\n\n\n=== Other factors to consider ===\nOther factors to consider when choosing and applying a learning algorithm include the following:\n\nHeterogeneity of the data.  If the feature vectors include features of many different kinds (discrete, discrete ordered, counts, continuous values), some algorithms are easier to apply than others.  Many algorithms, including Support Vector Machines, linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, and nearest neighbor methods, require that the input features be numerical and scaled to similar ranges (e.g., to the [-1,1] interval).  Methods that employ a distance function, such as nearest neighbor methods and support vector machines with Gaussian kernels, are particularly sensitive to this. An advantage of decision trees is that they easily handle heterogeneous data.\nRedundancy in the data.  If the input features contain redundant information (e.g., highly correlated features), some learning algorithms (e.g., linear regression, logistic regression, and distance based methods) will perform poorly because of numerical instabilities.  These problems can often be solved by imposing some form of regularization.\nPresence of interactions and non-linearities.  If each of the features makes an independent contribution to the output, then algorithms based on linear functions (e.g., linear regression, logistic regression, Support Vector Machines, naive Bayes) and distance functions (e.g., nearest neighbor methods, support vector machines with Gaussian kernels) generally perform well.  However, if there are complex interactions among features, then algorithms such as decision trees and neural networks work better, because they are specifically designed to discover these interactions.  Linear methods can also be applied, but the engineer must manually specify the interactions when using them.When considering a new application, the engineer can compare multiple learning algorithms and experimentally determine which one works best on the problem at hand (see cross validation).  Tuning the performance of a learning algorithm can be very time-consuming.  Given fixed resources, it is often better to spend more time collecting additional training data and more informative features than it is to spend extra time tuning the learning algorithms.\n\n\n=== Algorithms ===\nThe most widely used learning algorithms are: \n\nSupport Vector Machines\nlinear regression\nlogistic regression\nnaive Bayes\nlinear discriminant analysis\ndecision trees\nk-nearest neighbor algorithm\nNeural Networks (Multilayer perceptron)\nSimilarity learning\n\n\n== How supervised learning algorithms work ==\nGiven a set of \n  \n    \n      \n        N\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N}\n   training examples of the form \n  \n    \n      \n        {\n        (\n        \n          x\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          y\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        )\n        ,\n        .\n        .\n        .\n        ,\n        (\n        \n          x\n          \n            N\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n        \n          y\n          \n            N\n          \n        \n        )\n        }\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\{(x_{1},y_{1}),...,(x_{N},\\;y_{N})\\}}\n   such that \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x_{i}}\n   is the feature vector of the i-th example and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          y\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y_{i}}\n   is its label (i.e., class), a learning algorithm seeks a function \n  \n    \n      \n        g\n        :\n        X\n        \u2192\n        Y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle g:X\\to Y}\n  , where \n  \n    \n      \n        X\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle X}\n   is the input space and\n\n  \n    \n      \n        Y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle Y}\n   is the output space.

Empirical risk minimization seeks the function that best fits the training data.  Structural risk minimization includes a penalty function that controls the bias/variance tradeoff.\nIn both cases, it is assumed that the training set consists of a sample of independent and identically distributed pairs, \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        \n          x\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n        \n          y\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (x_{i},\\;y_{i})}\n  .

Generative training algorithms are often simpler and more computationally efficient than discriminative training algorithms.  In some cases, the solution can be computed in closed form as in naive Bayes and linear discriminant analysis.\n\n\n== Generalizations ==\nThere are several ways in which the standard supervised learning problem can be generalized:\n\nSemi-supervised learning: In this setting, the desired output values are provided only for a subset of the training data.  The remaining data is unlabeled.\nWeak supervision: In this setting, noisy, limited, or imprecise sources are used to provide supervision signal for labeling training data.\nActive learning: Instead of assuming that all of the training examples are given at the start, active learning algorithms interactively collect new examples, typically by making queries to a human user.  Often, the queries are based on unlabeled data, which is a scenario that combines semi-supervised learning with active learning.\nStructured prediction: When the desired output value is a complex object, such as a parse tree or a labeled graph, then standard methods must be extended.\nLearning to rank: When the input is a set of objects and the desired output is a ranking of those objects, then again the standard methods must be extended.\n\n\n== Approaches and algorithms ==\nAnalytical learning\nArtificial neural network\nBackpropagation\nBoosting (meta-algorithm)\nBayesian statistics\nCase-based reasoning\nDecision tree learning\nInductive logic programming\nGaussian process regression\nGenetic Programming\nGroup method of data handling\nKernel estimators\nLearning Automata\nLearning Classifier Systems\nMinimum message length (decision trees, decision graphs, etc.)\nMultilinear subspace learning\nNaive Bayes classifier\nMaximum entropy classifier\nConditional random field\nNearest Neighbor Algorithm\nProbably approximately correct learning (PAC) learning\nRipple down rules, a knowledge acquisition methodology\nSymbolic machine learning algorithms\nSubsymbolic machine learning algorithms\nSupport vector machines\nMinimum Complexity Machines (MCM)\nRandom Forests\nEnsembles of Classifiers\nOrdinal classification\nData Pre-processing\nHandling imbalanced datasets\nStatistical relational learning\nProaftn, a multicriteria classification algorithm\n\n\n== Applications ==\nBioinformatics\nCheminformatics\nQuantitative structure\u2013activity relationship\nDatabase marketing\nHandwriting recognition\nInformation retrieval\nLearning to rank\nInformation extraction\nObject recognition in computer vision\nOptical character recognition\nSpam detection\nPattern recognition\nSpeech recognition\nSupervised learning is a special case of Downward causation in biological systems\n\n\n== General issues ==\nComputational learning theory\nInductive bias\nOverfitting (machine learning)\n(Uncalibrated) Class membership probabilities\nUnsupervised learning\nVersion spaces\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of datasets for machine learning research\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMachine Learning Open Source Software (MLOSS)
