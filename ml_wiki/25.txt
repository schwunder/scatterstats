In statistics, Naive Bayes classifiers are a family of simple "probabilistic classifiers" based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (na\xefve) independence assumptions between the features. They are among the simplest Bayesian network models. But they could be coupled with Kernel density estimation and achieve higher accuracy levels.Na\xefve Bayes classifiers are highly scalable, requiring a number of parameters linear in the number of variables (features/predictors) in a learning problem. Maximum-likelihood training can be done by evaluating a closed-form expression, which takes linear time, rather than by expensive iterative approximation as used for many other types of classifiers.\nIn the statistics and computer science literature, naive Bayes models are known under a variety of names, including simple Bayes and independence Bayes. All these names reference the use of Bayes' theorem in the classifier's decision rule, but na\xefve Bayes is not (necessarily) a Bayesian method.\n\n\n== Introduction ==\nNaive Bayes is a simple technique for constructing classifiers: models that assign class labels to problem instances, represented as vectors of feature values, where the class labels are drawn from some finite set. There is not a single algorithm for training such classifiers, but a family of algorithms based on a common principle: all naive Bayes classifiers assume that the value of a particular feature is independent of the value of any other feature, given the class variable. For example, a fruit may be considered to be an apple if it is red, round, and about 10 cm in diameter.  A naive Bayes classifier considers each of these features to contribute independently to the probability that this fruit is an apple, regardless of any possible correlations between the color, roundness, and diameter features.\nFor some types of probability models, naive Bayes classifiers can be trained very efficiently in a supervised learning setting. In many practical applications, parameter estimation for naive Bayes models uses the method of maximum likelihood; in other words, one can work with the naive Bayes model without accepting Bayesian probability or using any Bayesian methods.\nDespite their naive design and apparently oversimplified assumptions, naive Bayes classifiers have worked quite well in many complex real-world situations. In 2004, an analysis of the Bayesian classification problem showed that there are sound theoretical reasons for the apparently implausible efficacy of naive Bayes classifiers. Still, a comprehensive comparison with other classification algorithms in 2006 showed that Bayes classification is outperformed by other approaches, such as boosted trees or random forests.An advantage of naive Bayes is that it only requires a small number of training data to estimate the parameters necessary for classification.\n\n\n== Probabilistic model ==\nAbstractly, na\xefve Bayes is a conditional probability model: given a problem instance to be classified, represented by a vector \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n        \n        =\n        (\n        \n          x\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \u2026\n        ,\n        \n          x\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {x} =(x_{1},\\ldots ,x_{n})}\n   representing some n features (independent variables), it assigns to this instance probabilities\n\n  \n    \n      \n        p\n        (\n        \n          C\n          \n            k\n          \n        \n        \u2223\n        \n          x\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \u2026\n        ,\n        \n          x\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n        )\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle p(C_{k}\\mid x_{1},\\ldots ,x_{n})\\,}\n  for each of K possible outcomes or classes \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          C\n          \n            k\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle C_{k}}\n  .The problem with the above formulation is that if the number of features n is large or if a feature can take on a large number of values, then basing such a model on probability tables is infeasible. We therefore reformulate the model to make it more tractable.

Bayes probability model. The na\xefve Bayes classifier combines this model with a decision rule. One common rule is to pick the hypothesis that is most probable; this is known as the maximum a posteriori or MAP decision rule. The corresponding classifier, a Bayes classifier, is the function that assigns a class label \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              y\n              ^\n            \n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          C\n          \n            k\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\hat {y}}=C_{k}}\n   for some k as follows:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              y\n              ^\n            \n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            argmax\n            \n              k\n              \u2208\n              {\n              1\n              ,\n              \u2026\n              ,\n              K\n              }\n            \n          \n        \n         \n        p\n        (\n        \n          C\n          \n            k\n          \n        \n        )\n        \n          \n            \u220f\n            \n              i\n              =\n              1\n            \n            \n              n\n            \n          \n          p\n          (\n          \n            x\n            \n              i\n            \n          \n          \u2223\n          \n            C\n            \n              k\n            \n          \n          )\n          .\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\hat {y}}={\\underset {k\\in \\{1,\\ldots ,K\\}}{\\operatorname {argmax} }}\\ p(C_{k})\\displaystyle \\prod _{i=1}^{n}p(x_{i}\\mid C_{k}).}\n  \n\n\n== Parameter estimation and event models ==\nA class's prior may be calculated by assuming equiprobable classes (i.e., priors = 1/<number of classes>), or by calculating an estimate for the class probability from the training set (i.e., <prior for a given class> = <number of samples in the class>/<total number of samples>). To estimate the parameters for a feature's distribution, one must assume a distribution or generate nonparametric models for the features from the training set.The assumptions on distributions of features are called the "event model" of the na\xefve Bayes classifier. For discrete features like the ones encountered in document classification (include spam filtering), multinomial and Bernoulli distributions are popular. These assumptions lead to two distinct models, which are often confused.\n\n\n=== Gaussian na\xefve Bayes ===\nWhen dealing with continuous data, a typical assumption is that the continuous values associated with each class are distributed according to a normal (or Gaussian) distribution. For example, suppose the training data contains a continuous attribute, \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x}\n  . We first segment the data by the class, and then compute the mean and variance of \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x}\n   in each class. Let \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \u03bc\n          \n            k\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mu _{k}}\n   be the mean of the values in \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x}\n   associated with class Ck, and let \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \u03c3\n          \n            k\n          \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\sigma _{k}^{2}}\n   be the Bessel corrected variance of the values in \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x}\n   associated with class Ck. Suppose we have collected some observation value \n  \n    \n      \n        v\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle v}\n  . Then, the probability distribution of \n  \n    \n      \n        v\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle v}\n   given a class \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          C\n          \n            k\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle C_{k}}\n  , \n  \n    \n      \n        p\n        (\n        x\n        =\n        v\n        \u2223\n        \n          C\n          \n            k\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle p(x=v\\mid C_{k})}\n  , can be computed by plugging \n  \n    \n      \n        v\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle v}\n   into the equation for a normal distribution parameterized by \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \u03bc\n          \n            k\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mu _{k}}\n   and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \u03c3\n          \n            k\n          \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\sigma _{k}^{2}}\n  .

In these cases, kernel density estimation can be used for a more realistic estimate of the marginal densities of each class. This method, which was introduced by John and Langley, can boost the accuracy of the classifier considerably. \n\n\n=== Multinomial na\xefve Bayes ===\nWith a multinomial event model, samples (feature vectors) represent the frequencies with which certain events have been generated by a multinomial \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        \n          p\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \u2026\n        ,\n        \n          p\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (p_{1},\\dots ,p_{n})}\n   where \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          p\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle p_{i}}\n   is the probability that event i occurs (or K such multinomials in the multiclass case).

frequency-based probability estimate will be zero, because the probability estimate is directly proportional to the number of occurrences of a feature's value. This is problematic because it will wipe out all information in the other probabilities when they are multiplied. Therefore, it is often desirable to incorporate a small-sample correction, called pseudocount, in all probability estimates such that no probability is ever set to be exactly zero. This way of regularizing naive Bayes is called Laplace smoothing when the pseudocount is one, and Lidstone smoothing in the general case.\nRennie et al. discuss problems with the multinomial assumption in the context of document classification and possible ways to alleviate those problems, including the use of tf\u2013idf weights instead of raw term frequencies and document length normalization, to produce a naive Bayes classifier that is competitive with support vector machines.\n\n\n=== Bernoulli na\xefve Bayes ===\nIn the multivariate Bernoulli event model, features are independent Booleans (binary variables) describing inputs.

This event model is especially popular for classifying short texts. It has the benefit of explicitly modelling the absence of terms. Note that a naive Bayes classifier with a Bernoulli event model is not the same as a multinomial NB classifier with frequency counts truncated to one.\n\n\n=== Semi-supervised parameter estimation ===\nGiven a way to train a na\xefve Bayes classifier from labeled data, it's possible to construct a semi-supervised training algorithm that can learn from a combination of labeled and unlabeled data by running the supervised learning algorithm in a loop:\nGiven a collection \n  \n    \n      \n        D\n        =\n        L\n        \u228e\n        U\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle D=L\\uplus U}\n   of labeled samples L and unlabeled samples U, start by training a na\xefve Bayes classifier on L.\nUntil convergence, do:\nPredict class probabilities \n  \n    \n      \n        P\n        (\n        C\n        \u2223\n        x\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle P(C\\mid x)}\n   for all examples x in \n  \n    \n      \n        D\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle D}\n  .\nRe-train the model based on the probabilities (not the labels) predicted in the previous step.Convergence is determined based on improvement to the model likelihood \n  \n    \n      \n        P\n        (\n        D\n        \u2223\n        \u03b8\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle P(D\\mid \\theta )}\n  , where \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03b8\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\theta }\n   denotes the parameters of the na\xefve Bayes model.\nThis training algorithm is an instance of the more general expectation\u2013maximization algorithm (EM): the prediction step inside the loop is the E-step of EM, while the re-training of na\xefve Bayes is the M-step. The algorithm is formally justified by the assumption that the data are generated by a mixture model, and the components of this mixture model are exactly the classes of the classification problem.\n\n\n== Discussion ==\nDespite the fact that the far-reaching independence assumptions are often inaccurate, the naive Bayes classifier has several properties that make it surprisingly useful in practice. In particular, the decoupling of the class conditional feature distributions means that each distribution can be independently estimated as a one-dimensional distribution. This helps alleviate problems stemming from the curse of dimensionality, such as the need for data sets that scale exponentially with the number of features. While naive Bayes often fails to produce a good estimate for the correct class probabilities, this may not be a requirement for many applications. For example, the naive Bayes classifier will make the correct MAP decision rule classification so long as the correct class is more probable than any other class. This is true regardless of whether the probability estimate is slightly, or even grossly inaccurate. In this manner, the overall classifier can be robust enough to ignore serious deficiencies in its underlying naive probability model. Other reasons for the observed success of the naive Bayes classifier are discussed in the literature cited below.\n\n\n=== Relation to logistic regression ===\nIn the case of discrete inputs (indicator or frequency features for discrete events), naive Bayes classifiers form a generative-discriminative pair with (multinomial) logistic regression classifiers: each naive Bayes classifier can be considered a way of fitting a probability model that optimizes the joint likelihood \n  \n    \n      \n        p\n        (\n        C\n        ,\n        \n          x\n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle p(C,\\mathbf {x} )}\n  , while logistic regression fits the same probability model to optimize the conditional \n  \n    \n      \n        p\n        (\n        C\n        \u2223\n        \n          x\n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle p(C\\mid \\mathbf {x} )}\n  .The link between the two can be seen by observing that the decision function for naive Bayes (in the binary case) can be rewritten as "predict class \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          C\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle C_{1}}\n   if the odds of \n  \n    \n      \n        p\n        (\n        \n          C\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        \u2223\n        \n          x\n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle p(C_{1}\\mid \\mathbf {x} )}\n   exceed those of \n  \n    \n      \n        p\n        (\n        \n          C\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        \u2223\n        \n          x\n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle p(C_{2}\\mid \\mathbf {x} )}\n  ".

classification ===\nHere is a worked example of naive Bayesian classification to the document classification problem.\nConsider the problem of classifying documents by their content, for example into spam and non-spam e-mails. Imagine that documents are drawn from a number of classes of documents which can be modeled as sets of words where the (independent) probability that the i-th word of a given document occurs in a document from class C can be written as\n\n  \n    \n      \n        p\n        (\n        \n          w\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        \u2223\n        C\n        )\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle p(w_{i}\\mid C)\\,}\n  (For this treatment, we simplify things further by assuming that words are randomly distributed in the document - that is, words are not dependent on the length of the document, position within the document with relation to other words, or other document-context.)\nThen the probability that a given document D contains all of the words \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          w\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle w_{i}}\n  , given a class C, is\n\n  \n    \n      \n        p\n        (\n        D\n        \u2223\n        C\n        )\n        =\n        \n          \u220f\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        p\n        (\n        \n          w\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        \u2223\n        C\n        )\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle p(D\\mid C)=\\prod _{i}p(w_{i}\\mid C)\\,}\n  The question that we desire to answer is: "what is the probability that a given document D belongs to a given class C?"

series of likelihood ratios.\nThe actual probability p(S | D) can be easily computed from log (p(S | D) / p(\xacS | D)) based on the observation that p(S | D) + p(\xacS | D) = 1.\nTaking the logarithm
