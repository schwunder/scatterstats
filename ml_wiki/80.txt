The Conference and Workshop on Neural Information Processing Systems (abbreviated as NeurIPS and formerly NIPS)  is a machine learning and computational neuroscience conference held every December.  The conference is currently a double-track meeting (single-track until 2015) that includes invited talks as well as oral and poster presentations of refereed papers, followed by parallel-track workshops that up to 2013 were held at ski resorts. \n\n\n== History ==\nThe NeurIPS meeting was first proposed in 1986 as NIPS at the annual invitation-only Snowbird Meeting on Neural Networks for Computing organized by The California Institute of Technology and Bell Laboratories.  NIPS was designed as a complementary open interdisciplinary meeting for researchers exploring biological and artificial Neural Networks.  Reflecting this multidisciplinary approach, NIPS began in 1987 with information theorist Ed Posner as the conference president and learning theorist Yaser Abu-Mostafa as program chairman. Research presented in the early NIPS meetings included a wide range of topics from efforts to solve purely engineering problems to the use of computer models as a tool for understanding biological nervous systems.  Since then, the biological and artificial systems research streams have diverged, and recent NeurIPS proceedings have been dominated by papers on machine learning, artificial intelligence and statistics.\nFrom 1987 until 2000 NIPS was held in Denver, United States. Since then, the conference was held in Vancouver, Canada (2001\u20132010), Granada, Spain (2011), and Lake Tahoe, United States (2012\u20132013). In 2014 and 2015, the conference was held in Montreal, Canada, in Barcelona, Spain in 2016, in Long Beach, United States in 2017, in Montreal, Canada in 2018 and Vancouver, Canada in 2019.  Reflecting its origins at Snowbird, Utah, the meeting was accompanied by workshops organized at a nearby ski resort up until 2013, when it outgrew ski resorts. In 2018, the abbreviation was changed to NeurIPS.\nThe first NeurIPS Conference was sponsored by the IEEE. The following NeurIPS Conferences have been organized by the NeurIPS Foundation, established by Ed Posner. Terrence Sejnowski has been the president of the NeurIPS Foundation since 1993, when Posner had a bicycle accident. The board of trustees consists of previous general chairs of the NeurIPS Conference.\nThe first proceedings was published in book form by the American Institute of Physics in 1987, and was entitled Neural Information Processing Systems, then the proceedings from the following conferences have been published by Morgan Kaufmann (1988\u20131993), MIT Press (1994\u20132004) and Curran Associates (2005\u2013present) under the name Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems.\n\n\n=== Official abbreviation of the name ===\nConference organizers considered abandoning the conference name because of a slang connotation of its abbreviation, NIPS, with the word nipples and as a slur against Japanese. After a comment period and survey of 2,270 conference participants, conference organizers decided to keep the name and instead considered changing the acronym, since that was the main concern. The key question in the survey was: \u201cDo you think we should change the name of the NIPS conference?\u201d Below are the absolute number of answers:\n\nOf the survey respondents, 1,881 were men and 294 were women. Of the women, 44% agreed a name change should occur and 40% disagreed. Of the men, 28% agreed a name change should occur and 55% disagreed. More than half of those surveyed were against the change, but 30% of those surveyed were in favor.  In response, the Neural Information Processing Systems Foundation Board of Trustees decided to change the official abbreviation and acronym of the conference from NIPS to NeurIPS.  \n\n\n== Topics ==\n\nThe conference had 5,000 registered participants in 2016, 8,000 in 2017, 10,000 in 2018 and 13,000 in 2019 (with 6,000 on a waiting list), making it the largest conference in Artificial Intelligence.  Besides machine learning and neuroscience, other fields represented at NeurIPS include cognitive science, psychology, computer vision, statistical linguistics, and information theory. Over the years, NeurIPS became a premier conference on machine learning and although the 'Neural' in the NeurIPS acronym had become something of a historical relic, the resurgence of deep learning in neural networks since 2012, fueled by faster computers and big data, has led to impressive achievement in speech recognition, object recognition in images, image captioning, language translation and world championship performance in the game of Go, based on neural architectures inspired by the hierarchy of areas in the visual cortex (ConvNet) and reinforcement learning inspired by the basal ganglia (Temporal difference learning). These foundational advances have been accompanied by a resurgence in artificial intelligence.\n\n\n=== Named lectures ===\nIn addition to invited talks and symposia, NeurIPS also organizes two named lectureships to recognize distinguished researchers. The NeurIPS Board introduced the Posner Lectureship in honor of NeurIPS founder Ed Posner; two Posner Lectures were given each year up to 2015. Past lecturers have included:\n\n2018 \u2013 Jo\xeblle Pineau\n2017 \u2013 John Platt\n2016 \u2013 Yann LeCun\n2015 \u2013 Zoubin Ghahramani and Vladimir Vapnik\n2014 \u2013 Michael Kearns and John Hopfield\n2013 \u2013 Daphne Koller and Peter Dayan\n2012 \u2013 Thomas Dietterich and Terry Sejnowski\n2011 \u2013 Rich Sutton and Bernhard Scholkopf\n2010 \u2013 Josh Tenenbaum and Michael I. JordanIn 2015, the NeurIPS Board introduced the Breiman Lectureship to highlight work in statistics relevant to conference topics. The lectureship was named for statistician Leo Breiman, who served on the NeurIPS Board from 1994 to 2005. Past lecturers have included:\n\n2019 \u2013 Bin Yu\n2018 \u2013 David Spiegelhalter\n2017 \u2013 Yee Whye Teh\n2016 \u2013 Susan Holmes\n2015 \u2013 Robert Tibshirani\n\n\n== The NIPS experiment ==\nIn NIPS 2014, the program chairs duplicated 10% of all submissions and sent them through separate reviewers to evaluate randomness in the reviewing process. Several researchers interpreted the result. Regarding whether the decision in NIPS is completely random or not, John Langford writes: "Clearly not\u2014a purely random decision would have arbitrariness of ~78%. It is, however, quite notable that 60% is much closer to 78% than 0%." He concludes that the result of the reviewing process is mostly arbitrary.\n\n\n== Editions ==\nPast editions:\n\n 1987\u20132000: Denver, Colorado, United States\n 2001\u20132010: Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada\n 2011: Granada, Spain, EU\n 2012 & 2013: Stateline, Nevada, United States\n 2014 & 2015: Montr\xe9al, Quebec, Canada\n 2016: Barcelona, Spain, EU \n 2017: Long Beach, California, United States\n 2018: Montr\xe9al, Quebec, Canada\n 2019: Vancouver, British Columbia, CanadaFuture editions:\n\n 2020: Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada\n 2021: Sydney, New South Wales, Australia\n\n\n== See also ==\nCOSYNE\nICML\nCIBB\nICLR\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n2019 Conference\nNeurIPS proceedings\nNIPS 2011 video lectures\nNIPS 2012 video lectures\nVideo Journal of Machine Learning Abstracts \u2013 Volume 3
