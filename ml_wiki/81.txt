The International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) is the leading international academic conference in machine learning. Along with NeurIPS, it is one of the two primary conferences of high impact in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence research. It is supported by the International Machine Learning Society (IMLS).\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first ICML was held 1980 in Pittsburgh.The conference completed its 25th anniversary in Helsinki, Finland in 2008.Recent conferences were held in Haifa, Israel (2010), Bellevue, Washington, USA (2011), Edinburgh, UK (2012), Atlanta, Georgia, USA (2013), and Beijing, China (2014), Lille, France (2015), New York City, USA (2016).\n\n\n== Editions ==\n ICML 2020 Vienna, Austria (virtual conference),\n ICML 2019 Los Angeles, United States\n ICML 2018 Stockholm, Sweden\n ICML 2017 Sydney, Australia\n ICML 2016 New York City, United States\n ICML 2015 Lille, France\n ICML 2014 Beijing, China\n ICML 2013 Atlanta, United States\n ICML 2012 Edinburgh, Great Britain\n ICML 2011 Bellevue, United States\n ICML 2010 Haifa, Israel\n ICML 2009 Montr\xe9al, Canada\n ICML 2008 Helsinki, Finland\n ICML 2007 Corvallis, Oregon, United States\n ICML 2006 Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States\n ICML 2005 Bonn, Germany, EU\n ICML 2004 Banff, Canada\n ICML 2003 Washington, DC, United States\n ICML 2002 Sydney, Australia\n ICML 2001 Williamstown, Massachusetts, United States\n ICML 2000 Stanford, California, United States\n\n\n== See also ==\nECML PKDD\nJournal of Machine Learning Research\nMachine Learning (journal)\nNeurIPS\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial site\nwww.conferencealert.com\nwww.conferencealerts.in\nwww.worldconferencealerts.com
