This list of Jewish mathematicians includes mathematicians and statisticians who are or were verifiably Jewish or of Jewish descent. In 1933, when the Nazis rose to power in Germany, one-third of all mathematics professors in the country were Jewish, while Jews constituted less than one percent of the population. Jewish mathematicians made major contributions throughout the 20th century and into the 21st, as is evidenced by their high representation among the winners of major mathematics awards: 27% for the Fields Medal, 30% for the Abel Prize, and 40% for the Wolf Prize.:V13:678\n\n\n== A ==\nAbner of Burgos (c. 1270\u2013c. 1347), mathematician and philosopher\nAbraham Abigdor (14th century), logician\nMilton Abramowitz (1915\u20131958), mathematician\nSamson Abramsky (born 1953), game semantics\nAmir Aczel (1950\u20132015), history of mathematics\nGeorgy Adelson-Velsky (1922\u20132014), mathematician and computer scientist\nAbraham Adelstein (1916\u20131992), statistics\nCaleb Afendopolo (c. 1430\u2013c. 1499), mathematician, astronomer, poet, and rabbi\nAaron Afia (16th century), mathematician, physician and philosopher\nShmuel Agmon (born 1922), mathematical analysis and partial differential equations\nMatest Agrest (1915\u20132005), mathematician and pseudoscientist\nRon Aharoni (born 1952), combinatorics\nBendich Ahin (14th century), mathematician and physician\nMichael Aizenman (born 1945), mathematician and physicist\nNaum Akhiezer (1901\u20131980), approximation theory\nIsaac Albalia (1035\u20131094), mathematician, astronomer, and Talmudist\nAbraham Adrian Albert (1905\u20131972), algebra;
