In computer science, online machine learning is a method of machine learning in which data becomes available in a sequential order and is used to update the best predictor for future data at each step, as opposed to batch learning techniques which generate the best predictor by learning on the entire training data set at once. Online learning is a common technique used in areas of machine learning where it is computationally infeasible to train over the entire dataset, requiring the need of out-of-core algorithms. It is also used in situations where it is necessary for the algorithm to dynamically adapt to new patterns in the data, or when the data itself is generated as a function of time, e.g., stock price prediction.\nOnline learning algorithms may be prone to catastrophic interference, a problem that can be addressed by incremental learning approaches.\n\n\n== Introduction ==\nIn the setting of supervised learning, a function of \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        :\n        X\n        \u2192\n        Y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f:X\\to Y}\n   is to be learned, where \n  \n    \n      \n        X\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle X}\n   is thought of as a space of inputs and \n  \n    \n      \n        Y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle Y}\n   as a space of outputs, that predicts well on instances that are drawn from a joint probability distribution \n  \n    \n      \n        p\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle p(x,y)}\n   on \n  \n    \n      \n        X\n        \xd7\n        Y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle X\\times Y}\n  .

Instead, the learner usually has access to a training set of examples \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        \n          x\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          y\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        )\n        ,\n        \u2026\n        ,\n        (\n        \n          x\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          y\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (x_{1},y_{1}),\\ldots ,(x_{n},y_{n})}\n  . In this setting, the loss function is given as \n  \n    \n      \n        V\n        :\n        Y\n        \xd7\n        Y\n        \u2192\n        \n          R\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle V:Y\\times Y\\to \\mathbb {R} }\n  , such that \n  \n    \n      \n        V\n        (\n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        ,\n        y\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle V(f(x),y)}\n   measures the difference between the predicted value \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f(x)}\n   and the true value \n  \n    \n      \n        y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y}\n  . The ideal goal is to select a function \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        \u2208\n        \n          \n            H\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f\\in {\\mathcal {H}}}\n  , where \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            H\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {H}}}\n   is a space of functions called a hypothesis space, so that some notion of total loss is minimised. Depending on the type of model (statistical or adversarial), one can devise different notions of loss, which lead to different learning algorithms.\n\n\n== Statistical view of online learning ==\nIn statistical learning models, the training sample \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        \n          x\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          y\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (x_{i},y_{i})}\n   are assumed to have been drawn from the true distribution \n  \n    \n      \n        p\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle p(x,y)}\n   and the objective is to minimize the expected "risk"\n\n  \n    \n      \n        I\n        [\n        f\n        ]\n        =\n        \n          E\n        \n        [\n        V\n        (\n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        ,\n        y\n        )\n        ]\n        =\n        \u222b\n        V\n        (\n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        ,\n        y\n        )\n        \n        d\n        p\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        )\n         \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle I[f]=\\mathbb {E} [V(f(x),y)]=\\int V(f(x),y)\\,dp(x,y)\\ .}\n  A common paradigm in this situation is to estimate a function \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              f\n              ^\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\hat {f}}}\n   through empirical risk minimization or regularized empirical risk minimization (usually Tikhonov regularization). The choice of loss function here gives rise to several well-known learning algorithms such as regularized least squares and support vector machines.\nA purely online model in this category would learn based on just the new input \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        \n          x\n          \n            t\n            +\n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          y\n          \n            t\n            +\n            1\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (x_{t+1},y_{t+1})}\n  , the current best predictor \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          f\n          \n            t\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f_{t}}\n   and some extra stored information (which is usually expected to have storage requirements independent of training data size). For many formulations, for example nonlinear kernel methods, true online learning is not possible, though a form of hybrid online learning with recursive algorithms can be used where \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          f\n          \n            t\n            +\n            1\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f_{t+1}}\n   is permitted to depend on \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          f\n          \n            t\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f_{t}}\n   and all previous data points \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        \n          x\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          y\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        )\n        ,\n        \u2026\n        ,\n        (\n        \n          x\n          \n            t\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          y\n          \n            t\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (x_{1},y_{1}),\\ldots ,(x_{t},y_{t})}\n  . In this case, the space requirements are no longer guaranteed to be constant since it requires storing all previous data points, but the solution may take less time to compute with the addition of a new data point, as compared to batch learning techniques.\nA common strategy to overcome the above issues is to learn using mini-batches, which process a small batch of \n  \n    \n      \n        b\n        \u2265\n        1\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle b\\geq 1}\n   data points at a time, this can be considered as pseudo-online learning for \n  \n    \n      \n        b\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle b}\n   much smaller than the total number of training points. Mini-batch techniques are used with repeated passing over the training data to obtain optimized out-of-core versions of machine learning algorithms, for example, stochastic gradient descent. When combined with backpropagation, this is currently the de facto training method for training artificial neural networks.\n\n\n=== Example: linear least squares ===\n\nThe simple example of linear least squares is used to explain a variety of ideas in online learning.

Such a sequence can be stochastic or deterministic. The number of iterations is then decoupled to the number of points (each point can be considered more than once). The incremental gradient method can be shown to provide a minimizer to the empirical risk. Incremental techniques can be advantageous when considering objective functions made up of a sum of many terms e.g. an empirical error corresponding to a very large dataset.\n\n\n=== Kernel methods ===\n\nKernels can be used to extend the above algorithms to non-parametric models (or models where the parameters form an infinite dimensional space). The corresponding procedure will no longer be truly online and instead involve storing all the data points, but is still faster than the brute force method.\nThis discussion is restricted to the case of the square loss, though it can be extended to any convex loss.

For example, in online classification, the prediction domain and the loss functions are not convex. In such scenarios, two simple techniques for convexification are used: randomisation and surrogate loss functions.\nSome simple online convex optimisation algorithms are:\n\n\n==== Follow the leader (FTL) ====\nThe simplest learning rule to try is to select (at the current step) the hypothesis that has the least loss over all past rounds.

For the case of online quadratic optimization (where the loss function is \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          v\n          \n            t\n          \n        \n        (\n        w\n        )\n        =\n        \n          |\n        \n        \n          |\n        \n        w\n        \u2212\n        \n          x\n          \n            t\n          \n        \n        \n          |\n        \n        \n          \n            |\n          \n          \n            2\n          \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle v_{t}(w)=||w-x_{t}||_{2}^{2}}\n  ), one can show a regret bound that grows as \n  \n    \n      \n        log\n        \u2061\n        (\n        T\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\log(T)}\n  . However, similar bounds cannot be obtained for the FTL algorithm for other important families of models like online linear optimization. To do so, one modifies FTL by adding regularisation.\n\n\n==== Follow the regularised leader (FTRL) ====\nThis is a natural modification of FTL that is used to stabilise the FTL solutions and obtain better regret bounds.

Indeed, in the case of an infinite stream of data, since the examples \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        \n          x\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          y\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        )\n        ,\n        (\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          y\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        )\n        ,\n        \u2026\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (x_{1},y_{1}),(x_{2},y_{2}),\\ldots }\n   are assumed to be drawn i.i.d. from the distribution \n  \n    \n      \n        p\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle p(x,y)}\n  , the sequence of gradients of \n  \n    \n      \n        V\n        (\n        \u22c5\n        ,\n        \u22c5\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle V(\\cdot ,\\cdot )}\n   in the above iteration are an i.i.d. sample of stochastic estimates of the gradient of the expected risk \n  \n    \n      \n        I\n        [\n        w\n        ]\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle I[w]}\n   and therefore one can apply complexity results for the stochastic gradient descent method to bound the deviation \n  \n    \n      \n        I\n        [\n        \n          w\n          \n            t\n          \n        \n        ]\n        \u2212\n        I\n        [\n        \n          w\n          \n            \u2217\n          \n        \n        ]\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle I[w_{t}]-I[w^{\\ast }]}\n  , where \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          w\n          \n            \u2217\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle w^{\\ast }}\n   is the minimizer of \n  \n    \n      \n        I\n        [\n        w\n        ]\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle I[w]}\n  . This interpretation is also valid in the case of a finite training set; although with multiple passes through the data the gradients are no longer independent, still complexity results can be obtained in special cases.\nThe second interpretation applies to the case of a finite training set and considers the SGD algorithm as an instance of incremental gradient descent method. In this case, one instead looks at the empirical risk:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          I\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n        [\n        w\n        ]\n        =\n        \n          \n            1\n            n\n          \n        \n        \n          \u2211\n          \n            i\n            =\n            1\n          \n          \n            n\n          \n        \n        V\n        (\n        \u27e8\n        w\n        ,\n        \n          x\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        \u27e9\n        ,\n        \n          y\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        )\n         \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle I_{n}[w]={\\frac {1}{n}}\\sum _{i=1}^{n}V(\\langle w,x_{i}\\rangle ,y_{i})\\ .}\n  Since the gradients of \n  \n    \n      \n        V\n        (\n        \u22c5\n        ,\n        \u22c5\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle V(\\cdot ,\\cdot )}\n   in the incremental gradient descent iterations are also stochastic estimates of the gradient of \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          I\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n        [\n        w\n        ]\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle I_{n}[w]}\n  , this interpretation is also related to the stochastic gradient descent method, but applied to minimize the empirical risk as opposed to the expected risk. Since this interpretation concerns the empirical risk and not the expected risk, multiple passes through the data are readily allowed and actually lead to tighter bounds on the deviations \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          I\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n        [\n        \n          w\n          \n            t\n          \n        \n        ]\n        \u2212\n        \n          I\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n        [\n        \n          w\n          \n            n\n          \n          \n            \u2217\n          \n        \n        ]\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle I_{n}[w_{t}]-I_{n}[w_{n}^{\\ast }]}\n  , where \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          w\n          \n            n\n          \n          \n            \u2217\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle w_{n}^{\\ast }}\n   is the minimizer of \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          I\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n        [\n        w\n        ]\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle I_{n}[w]}\n  .\n\n\n== Implementations ==\nVowpal Wabbit: Open-source fast out-of-core online learning system which is notable for supporting a number of machine learning reductions, importance weighting and a selection of different loss functions and optimisation algorithms.
